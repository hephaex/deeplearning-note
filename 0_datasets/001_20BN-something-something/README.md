# introduction
The 20BN-SOMETHING-SOMETHING dataset is a large collection of densely-labeled video clips that show humans performing pre-defined basic actions with everyday objects. The dataset was created by a large number of crowd workers. It allows machine learning models to develop fine-grained understanding of basic actions that occur in the physical world. It is available free of charge for academic research. Commercial licenses are available upon request.
