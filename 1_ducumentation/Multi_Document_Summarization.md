#ABSTRACT & CONCLUSION
- compare two approaches of summarization
    - sentence extraction based approach [**MEAD**](http://www.summarization.com/mead/) (an open source package)
    - language generation based approach **SEA**
- conclusion
    - both perform equally well quantitatively
        - **MEAD**: **varied language** and **details** but **lack in accuracy**, **fail to give an overview**
        - **SEA**: provide **general overview** but **sounding 'robotic'**, **repetitive** and **incoherent** (rời rạc, ko mạch lạc)
    - both perform different but for complementary reasons
    - should synthesize two approaches

#INTRODUCTION
- **INDUSTRIAL NEEDS**
    - Online customer reviews, summaries of this literature could be of great strategic value to product designers, planners and manufactures
    - Other important commercial applications such as **summarization of travel logs**
    - non-commercial applications such as the **summarization of candidate reviews**

- **PROBLEM**
    - how to effectively summarize a large corpora of evaluative text about a single entity e.g. a product
    - for factual documents, the goal is to **extract important facts** and present them in a **sensible ordering** while **avoiding repetition**
    - when documents contain **inconsistent info** e.g. conflicting report, the goal is to identify overlaps and inconsistencies and produce a summary that points out and explain those inconsistencies.
