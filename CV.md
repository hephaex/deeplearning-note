## DiffusionCLIP: Text-Guided Diffusion Models for Robust Image Manipulation (CVPR 2022) 
Abstract: Recently, GAN inversion methods combined with Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) enables zero-shot image manipulation guided by text prompts. However, their applications to diverse real images are still difficult due to the limited GAN inversion capability. Specifically, these approaches often have difficulties in reconstructing images with novel poses, views, and highly variable contents compared to the training data, altering object identity, or producing unwanted image artifacts. To mitigate these problems and enable faithful manipulation of real images, we propose a novel method, dubbed DiffusionCLIP, that performs text-driven image manipulation using diffusion models. Based on full inversion capability and high-quality image generation power of recent diffusion models, our method performs zero-shot image manipulation successfully even between unseen domains and takes another step towards general application by manipulating images from a widely varying ImageNet dataset. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise combination method that allows straightforward multi-attribute manipulation. Extensive experiments and human evaluation confirmed robust and superior manipulation performance of our methods compared to the existing baselines.

## akka-stream
다이나믹 배치를 구현하고 있고 충분히 작은 모델이라면 10000 ~ 20000  requests / sec 수준의 응답 성능을 낼 수 있습니다.
구현에 사용된 akka는 프레임워크가 아닌 고도의 동시성, 병렬성, 분산성을 가지고 있는 메세지 기반 어플레케이션 구축 툴킷으로 간주할 수 있습니다.
충분히 생산성이 있는 언어를 베이스로 하고 있기 때문에 직접 서빙 데몬에서 monolithic 한 구조로 비지니스 코드를 내재화 하는것도 가능합니다. 
예제의 코드량이 적고 추상화가 거의 없는 naive한 구현이기 때문에 동작에 관련한 거의 대부분의 요소를 블랙박스 없이 확인하고 동시에 환경 튜닝이 가능합니다.
실제 예제의 사용성은 웹과 상호 작용을 하는 어플리케이션 보다는 검색, 추천, 대화 시스템등 다수의 모델을 컨트롤하는 기반 플랫폼 시스템에 적합합니다.
