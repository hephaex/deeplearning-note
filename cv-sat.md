# Techniques
This section explores the different deep and machine learning (ML) techniques applied to common problems in satellite imagery analysis. Good background reading is [Deep learning in remote sensing applications: A meta-analysis and review](https://www.iges.or.jp/en/publication_documents/pub/peer/en/6898/Ma+et+al+2019.pdf)

## Classification
The classic cats vs dogs image classification task, which in the remote sensing domain is used to assign a label to an image, e.g. this is an image of a forest. The more complex case is applying multiple labels to an image. This approach of image level classification is not to be confused with pixel-level classification which is called semantic segmentation. In general, aerial images cover large geographical areas that include multiple classes of land, so treating this is as a classification problem is less common than using semantic segmentation.

## Segmentation
Segmentation will assign a class label to each **pixel** in an image. Segmentation is typically grouped into semantic or instance segmentation. In semantic segmentation objects of the same class are assigned the same label, whilst in instance segmentation each object is assigned a unique label. Read this [beginner’s guide to segmentation](https://medium.com/gsi-technology/a-beginners-guide-to-segmentation-in-satellite-images-9c00d2028d52). Single class models are often trained for road or building segmentation, with multi class for land use/crop type classification. Image annotation can take long than for classification/object detection since every pixel must be annotated. **Note** that many articles which refer to 'hyperspectral land classification' are actually describing semantic segmentation.

### Semantic segmentation

### Instance segmentation
In instance segmentation, each individual 'instance' of a segmented area is given a unique lable. For detection of very small objects this may a good approach, but it can struggle seperating individual objects that are closely spaced.
* [Mask_RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It is very commonly used for instance segmentation & object detection

## Object detection
Several different techniques can be used to count the number of objects in an image. The returned data can be an object count (regression), a bounding box around individual objects in an image (typically using Yolo or Faster R-CNN architectures), a pixel mask for each object (instance segmentation), key points for an an object (such as wing tips, nose and tail of an aircraft), or simply a classification for a sliding tile over an image. A good introduction to the challenge of performing object detection on aerial imagery is given in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06042v2). In summary, images are large and objects may comprise only a few pixels, easily confused with random features in background. For the same reason, object detection datasets are inherently imbalanced, since the area of background typically dominates over the area of the objects to be detected. In general object detecion performs well on large objects, and gets increasingly difficult as the objects get smaller & more densely packed. Model accuracy falls off rapidly as image resolution degrades, so it is common for object detection to use very high resolution imagery, e.g. 30cm RGB. A particular characteristic of aerial images is that objects can be oriented in any direction, so using rotated bounding boxes which aligning with the object can be crucial for extracting metrics such as the length and width of an object.

Super-resolution attempts to enhance the resolution of an imaging system, and can be applied as a pre-processing step to improve the detection of small objects. For an introduction to this topic [read this excellent article](https://bleedai.com/super-resolution-going-from-3x-to-8x-resolution-in-opencv/).

## Few/one/zero/low shot learning
This is a class of techniques which attempt to make predictions for classes with few, one or even zero examples provided during training. In zero shot learning (ZSL) the model is assisted by the provision of auxiliary information which typically consists of descriptions/semantic attributes/word embeddings for both the seen and unseen classes at train time ([ref](https://learnopencv.com/zero-shot-learning-an-introduction/)). These approaches are particularly relevant to remote sensing, where there may be many examples of common classes, but few or even zero examples for other classes of interest.

## Self/semi/un-supervised & contrastive learning
The terms self-supervised, semi-supervised, un-supervised, contrastive learning & SSL describe techniques using un-labelled data. In general, the more classical techniques such as k-means classification or PCA are referred to as unsupervised, whilst newer techniques using CNN feature extraction or autoencoders are referred to as self-supervised. [Yann LeCun](https://braindump.jethro.dev/posts/lecun_cake_analogy/) has described self-supervised/unsupervised learning as the 'base of the cake': *If we think of our brain as a cake, then the cake base is unsupervised learning. The machine predicts any part of its input for any observed part, all without the use of labelled data. Supervised learning forms the icing on the cake, and reinforcement learning is the cherry on top.*

## Active learning
Supervised deep learning techniques typically require a huge number of labelled examples for form a training dataset. However labelling at scale take significant time, expertise and resources. Active learning techniques aim to reduce the total amount of annotation that needs to be performed by selecting the most useful images to label from a large pool of unlabelled examples, thus reducing the time to generate training datasets. These processes may be referred to as [Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning](https://medium.com/pytorch/https-medium-com-robert-munro-active-learning-with-pytorch-2f3ee8ebec)

## Neural nets in space
Processing on board a satellite allows less data to be downlinked. e.g. super-resolution image might take 8 images to generate, then a single image is downlinked. Other applications include cloud detection and collision avoidance.
* [Lockheed Martin and USC to Launch Jetson-Based Nanosatellite for Scientific Research Into Orbit - Aug 2020](https://news.developer.nvidia.com/lockheed-martin-usc-jetson-nanosatellite/) - One app that will run on the GPU-accelerated satellite is SuperRes, an AI-based application developed by Lockheed Martin, that can automatically enhance the quality of an image.

# ML best practice
This section includes tips and ideas I have picked up from other practitioners including [ai-fast-track](https://github.com/ai-fast-track), [FraPochetti](https://github.com/FraPochetti) & the IceVision community
* Almost all imagery data on the internet is in RGB format, and common techniques designed for working with this 3 band imagery may fail or need significant adaptation to work with multiband data (e.g. 13-band Sentinel 2)
* In general, classification and object detection models are created using transfer learning, where the majority of the weights are not updated in training but have been pre computed using standard vision datasets such as ImageNet
* Since satellite images are typically very large, it is common to tile them before processing. Alternatively checkout [Fully Convolutional Image Classification on Arbitrary Sized Image](https://learnopencv.com/fully-convolutional-image-classification-on-arbitrary-sized-image/) -> TLDR replace the fully-connected layer with a convolution-layer
* Where you have small sample sizes, e.g. for a small object class which may be under represented in your training dataset, use image augmentation
* In general, larger models will outperform smaller models, particularly on challenging tasks such as detecting small objetcs
* If model performance in unsatisfactory, try to increase your dataset size before switching to another model architecture
* In training, whenever possible increase the batch size, as small batch sizes produce poor normalization statistics
* The vast majority of the literature uses supervised learning with the requirement for large volumes of annotated data, which is a bottleneck to development and deployment. We are just starting to see self-supervised approaches applied to remote sensing data
* [4-ways-to-improve-class-imbalance](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-ways-to-improve-class-imbalance-for-image-data-9adec8f390f1) discusses the pros and cons of several rebalancing techniques, applied to an aerial dataset. Reason to read: models can reach an accuracy ceiling where majority classes are easily predicted but minority classes poorly predicted. Overall model accuracy may not improve until steps are taken to account for class imbalance.

# ML metrics
A number of metrics are common to all model types (but can have slightly different meanings in contexts such as object detection), whilst other metrics are very specific to particular classes of model. The correct choice of metric is particularly critical for imbalanced dataset problems, e.g. object detection
* TP = true positive, FP = false positive, TN = true negative, FN = false negative
* `Precision` is the % of correct positive predictions, calculated as `precision = TP/(TP+FP)`
* `Recall` or **true positive rate** (TPR), is the % of true positives captured by the model, calculated as `recall = TP/(TP+FN)`. Note that FN is not possible in object detection, so recall is not appropriate.
* The `F1 score` (also called the F-score or the F-measure) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as `F1 = 2*(precision * recall)/(precision + recall)`. It conveys the balance between the precision and the recall. [Ref](https://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-accuracy-is-not-enough-more-performance-measures-you-can-use/)
* The **false positive rate** (FPR), calculated as `FPR = FP/(FP+TN)` is often plotted against recall/TPR in an [ROC curve](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc) which shows how the TPR/FPR tradeoff varies with classification threshold. Lowering the classification threshold returns more true positives, but also more false positives. Note that since FN is not possible in object detection, ROC curves are not appropriate.
* Precision-vs-recall curves visualise the tradeoff between making false positives and false negatives
* [Accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification) is the most commonly used metric in 'real life' but can be a highly misleading metric for imbalanced data sets.
* `IoU` is an object detection specific metric, being the average intersect over union of prediction and ground truth bounding boxes for a given confidence threshold
* `mAP@0.5` is another object detection specific metric, being the mean value of the average precision for each class. `@0.5` sets a threshold for how much of the predicted bounding box overlaps the ground truth bounding box, i.e. "minimum 50% overlap"
* For more comprehensive definitions checkout [Object-Detection-Metrics](https://github.com/rafaelpadilla/Object-Detection-Metrics)

# Free online compute
A GPU is required for training deep learning models (but not necessarily for inferencing), and this section lists a couple of free Jupyter environments with GPU available. There is a good overview of online Jupyter development environments [on the fastai site](https://course19.fast.ai). I personally use Colab Pro with data hosted on Google Drive, or Sagemaker if I have very long running training jobs.

## Google Colab
* Collaboratory [notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com) with GPU as a backend for free for 12 hours at a time. Note that the GPU may be shared with other users, so if you aren't getting good performance try reloading.
* Also a pro tier for $10 a month -> https://colab.research.google.com/signup
* Tensorflow, pytorch & fastai available but you may need to update them
* [Colab Alive](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colab-alive/eookkckfbbgnhdgcbfbicoahejkdoele?hl=en) is a chrome extension that keeps Colab notebooks alive.
* [colab-ssh](https://github.com/WassimBenzarti/colab-ssh) -> lets you ssh to a colab instance like it’s an EC2 machine and install packages that require full linux functionality

## Kaggle - also Google!
* Free to use
* GPU Kernels - may run for 1 hour
* Tensorflow, pytorch & fastai available but you may need to update them
* Advantage that many datasets are already available

## Others
* [Paperspace gradient](https://gradient.run/notebooks) -> free tier includes GPU usage
* [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) -> many features for collaboration, GPU use is paid

# State of the art engineering
* Compute and data storage are moving to the cloud. Read how [Planet](https://cloud.google.com/customers/planet) and [Airbus](https://cloud.google.com/customers/airbus) use the cloud
* Google Earth Engine and Microsoft Planetary Computer are democratising access to massive compute platforms
* No-code platforms and auto-ml are making ML techniques more accessible than ever
* Custom hardware is being developed for rapid training and inferencing with deep learning models, both in the datacenter and at the edge
* Supervised ML methods typically require large annotated datasets, but approaches such as self-supervised and active learning are offering alternatives pathways
* Traditional data formats aren't designed for processing on the cloud, so new standards are evolving such as COGS and STAC
* Computer vision traditionally delivered high performance image processing on a CPU by using compiled languages like C++, as used by OpenCV for example. The advent of GPUs are changing the paradigm, with alternatives optimised for GPU being created, such as [Kornia](https://kornia.github.io/)
* Whilst the combo of python and keras/tensorflow/pytorch are currently preeminent, new python libraries such as [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) and alternative languages such as [Julia](https://julialang.org/) are showing serious promise

# Cloud providers
An overview of the most relevant services provided by AWS and Google. Also consider Microsoft Azure, or one of the many smaller but more specialised platorms such as [spell.ml](https://spell.ml/) or [paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/)

## AWS
* Host your data on [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and metadata in a db such as [postgres](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/)
* For batch processing use [Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/). GPU instances are available for [batch deep learning](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/deep-learning-on-aws-batch/) inferencing. See how Rastervision implement this [here](https://docs.rastervision.io/en/0.13/cloudformation.html)
* If processing can be performed in 15 minutes or less, serverless [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions are an attractive option owing to their ability to scale. Note that lambda may not be a particularly quick solution for deep learning applications, since you do not have the option to batch inference on a GPU. Creating a docker container with all the required dependencies can be a challenge. To get started read [Using container images to run PyTorch models in AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/using-container-images-to-run-pytorch-models-in-aws-lambda/) and for an image classification example [checkout this repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-lambda-docker-serverless-inference). Also read [Processing satellite imagery with serverless architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/processing-satellite-imagery-with-serverless-architecture/) which discusses queuing & lambda. For managing a serverless infrastructure composed of multiple lambda functions use [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/index.html)
* Use [Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue) for data preprocessing - or use Sagemaker
* To orchestrate basic data pipelines use [Step functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/). Use the [AWS Step Functions Workflow Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-step-functions-workflow-studio-a-low-code-visual-tool-for-building-state-machines/) to get started. Read [Orchestrating and Monitoring Complex, Long-running Workflows Using AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/field-notes-orchestrating-and-monitoring-complex-long-running-workflows-using-aws-step-functions/). Note that step functions are defined in JSON
* If step functions are too limited or you want to write pipelines in python and use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for workflow management, checkout hosted [AWS managed Airflow](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow/). Read [Orchestrate XGBoost ML Pipelines with Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/orchestrate-xgboost-ml-pipelines-with-amazon-managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow/) and checkout [amazon-mwaa-examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-mwaa-examples)
* [Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is a whole ecosystem of ML tools that includes a hosted Jupyter environment for training of ML models. There are also tools for deployment of models using docker.
* [Deep learning AMIs](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/) are EC2 instances with deep learning frameworks preinstalled. They do require more setup from the user than Sagemaker but in return allow access to the underlying hardware, which makes debugging issues more straightforward. There is a [good guide to setting up your AMI instance on the Keras blog](https://blog.keras.io/running-jupyter-notebooks-on-gpu-on-aws-a-starter-guide.html)
* Specifically created for deep learning inferencing is [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/)
* [Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/custom-labels-features/) custom labels is a 'no code' annotation, training and inferencing service. Read [Training models using Satellite (Sentinel-2) imagery on Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels](https://ryfeus.medium.com/training-models-using-satellite-imagery-on-amazon-rekognition-custom-labels-dd44ac6a3812). For a comparison with Azure and Google alternatives [read this article](https://blog.roboflow.com/automl-vs-rekognition-vs-custom-vision/)
* When developing you will definitely want to use [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) and probably [aws-data-wrangler](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler)
* For managing infrastructure use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Alternatively if you wish to use TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, or C# checkout [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/), although I found relatively few examples to get going using python
* [AWS Ground Station now supports data delivery to Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/04/aws-ground-station-now-supports-data-delivery-to-amazon-s3/)
* [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) is a fast, scalable data warehouse that can extend queries to S3. Redshift is based on PostgreSQL but [has some differences](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_redshift-and-postgres-sql.html). Redshift supports geospatial data.
* [AWS App Runner](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-aws-app-runner/) enables quick deployment of containers as apps
* [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) allows running SQL queries against CSV files stored on S3. Serverless so pay only for the queries you run
* If you are using pytorch checkout [the S3 plugin for pytorch](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/announcing-the-amazon-s3-plugin-for-pytorch/) which provides streaming data access

## Google cloud
* For storage use [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) (AWS S3 equivalent)
* For data warehousing use [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) (AWS Redshift equivalent). Visualize massive spatial datasets directly in BigQuery using [CARTO](https://carto.com/bigquery-tiler/)
* For model training use [Vertex](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) (AWS Sagemaker equivalent)
* For containerised apps use [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) (AWS App Runner equivalent but can scale to zero)

# Deploying models
This section discusses how to get a trained machine learning & specifically deep learning model into production. For an overview on serving deep learning models checkout [Practical-Deep-Learning-on-the-Cloud](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/-Practical-Deep-Learning-on-the-Cloud). There are many options if you are happy to dedicate a server, although you may want a GPU for batch processing. For serverless use AWS lambda.

## Rest API on dedicated server
A common approach to serving up deep learning model inference code is to wrap it in a rest API. The API can be implemented in python (flask or FastAPI), and hosted on a dedicated server e.g. EC2 instance. Note that making this a scalable solution will require significant experience.
* Basic API: https://blog.keras.io/building-a-simple-keras-deep-learning-rest-api.html with code [here](https://github.com/jrosebr1/simple-keras-rest-api)
* Advanced API with request queuing: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/01/29/scalable-keras-deep-learning-rest-api/

## Framework/provider specific model serving options
If you are happy to live with some lock-in, these are good options:
* [Tensorflow serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving) is limited to Tensorflow models
* [Pytorch serve](https://github.com/pytorch/serve) is easy to use, limited to Pytorch models, can be deployed via AWS Sagemaker
* [sagemaker-inference-toolkit](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-inference-toolkit) -> Serve machine learning models within a Docker container using AWS SageMaker

## NVIDIA Triton server
* The [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server) provides an optimized cloud and edge inferencing solution
* Supports TensorFlow, ONNX, PyTorch TorchScript and OpenVINO model formats. Both TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2.x are supported.
* Read [CAPE Analytics Uses Computer Vision to Put Geospatial Data and Risk Information in Hands of Property Insurance Companies](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/05/21/cape-analytics-computer-vision/)
* Available on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08NHXW4MN)

## Model optimisation for deployment
The general approaches are outlined in [this article from NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/preparing-models-for-object-detection-with-real-and-synthetic-data-and-tao-toolkit/) which discusses fine tuning a model pre-trained on synthetic data (Rareplanes) with 10% real data, then pruning the model to reduce its size, before quantizing the model to improve inference speed.

# Image annotation
For supervised machine learning, you will require annotated images. For example if you are performing object detection you will need to annotate images with bounding boxes. Check that your annotation tool of choice supports large image (likely geotiff) files, as not all will. Note that GeoJSON is widely used by remote sensing researchers but this annotation format is not commonly supported in general computer vision frameworks, and in practice you may have to convert the annotation format to use the data with your chosen framework. There are both closed and open source tools for creating and converting annotation formats. Some of these tools are simply for performing annotation, whilst others add features such as dataset management and versioning.

# About the author
My background is in optical physics, and I hold a PhD from Cambridge on the topic of [localised surface Plasmons](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl0710506). Since academia I have held a variety of roles, including doing research at [Sharp Labs Europe](https://www.sle.sharp.co.uk/), developing optical systems at [Surrey Satellites](https://www.sstl.co.uk/) (SSTL), and working at an IOT startup. It was whilst at SSTL that I started this repository as a personal resource. Over time I have steadily gravitated towards data analytics and software engineering with python, and I now work as a senior data scientist at [Satellite Vu](https://www.satellitevu.com/). Please feel free to connect with me on Twitter & LinkedIn, and please do let me know if this repository is useful to your work.
