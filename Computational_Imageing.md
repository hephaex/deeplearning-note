# Computational Vision
 Computational Imaging is a the process of indirectly forming images from measurements using algorithms that rely on a significant amount of computing. 
 In contrast to traditional imaging, computational imaging systems involve a tight integration of the sensing system and the computation in order to form the images of interest. 
 The ubiquitous availability of fast computing platforms (such as multi-core CPUs and GPUs), the advances in algorithms and modern sensing hardware is resulting in imaging systems with significantly enhanced capabilities. 
 Computational Imaging systems cover a broad range of applications include computational microscopy,[1] tomographic imaging, MRI, ultrasound imaging, computational photography, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), seismic imaging etc. 
 The integration of the sensing and the computation in computational imaging systems allows for accessing information which was otherwise not possible.

## Stanford University/NVIDIA, via Sergio Valmorisco Sierra:
" Current state-of-the-art GANs have seen immense progress, but they commonly operate in 2D and do not explicitly model the underlying 3D scenes. Recent work on 3D-aware GANs has begun to tackle the problem of multi-view-consistent image synthesis and, to a lesser extent, extraction of 3D shapes without being supervised on geometry or multi-view image collections. However, the image quality and resolution of existing 3D GANs have lagged far behind those of 2D GANs. One of the primary reasons for this gap is the computational inefficiency of previously employed 3D generators and neural rendering architectures.
The authors of this paper introduce a novel generator architecture for unsupervised 3D representation learning from a collection of single-view 2D photographs that seeks to improve the computational efficiency of rendering while remaining true to 3D-grounded neural rendering.
For this purpose, the authors introduce an expressive hybrid explicit-implicit network architecture that, together with other design choices, synthesizes not only high-resolution multi-view-consistent images in real-time but also produces high-quality 3D geometry. By decoupling feature generation and neural rendering, their framework is able to leverage state-of-the-art 2D CNN generators, such as StyleGAN2, and inherit their efficiency and expressiveness."

## Face Pyramid Vision Transformer
- 33rd British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) 2022, 21st - 24th November 2022, London, UK. 
- Project Page: https://khawar-islam.github.io/fpvt/
- Code: https: https://github.com/khawar-islam/FPVT_BMVC22

#### Highlights:
A novel Face Pyramid Vision Transformer (FPVT) is proposed to learn a discriminative multi-scale facial representations for face recognition and verification. In FPVT, Face Spatial Reduction Attention (FSRA) and Dimensionality Reduction (FDR) layers are employed to make the feature maps compact, thus reducing the computations. An Improved Patch Embedding (IPE) algorithm is proposed to exploit the benefits of CNNs in ViTs (e.g., shared weights, local context, and receptive fields) to model lower-level edges to higher-level semantic primitives. Within FPVT framework, a Convolutional Feed-Forward Network (CFFN) is proposed that extracts locality information to learn low level facial information. The proposed FPVT is evaluated on seven benchmark datasets and compared with ten existing state-of-the-art methods, including CNNs, pure ViTs, and Convolutional ViTs. Despite fewer parameters, FPVT has demonstrated excellent performance over the compared methods. I am greatly thankful to my coauthors Arif Mahmood and Zaigham Zaheer for their supervision and guidance throughout the project.

## DiffusionCLIP: Text-Guided Diffusion Models for Robust Image Manipulation (CVPR 2022) 
Abstract: Recently, GAN inversion methods combined with Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) enables zero-shot image manipulation guided by text prompts. However, their applications to diverse real images are still difficult due to the limited GAN inversion capability. Specifically, these approaches often have difficulties in reconstructing images with novel poses, views, and highly variable contents compared to the training data, altering object identity, or producing unwanted image artifacts. To mitigate these problems and enable faithful manipulation of real images, we propose a novel method, dubbed DiffusionCLIP, that performs text-driven image manipulation using diffusion models. Based on full inversion capability and high-quality image generation power of recent diffusion models, our method performs zero-shot image manipulation successfully even between unseen domains and takes another step towards general application by manipulating images from a widely varying ImageNet dataset. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise combination method that allows straightforward multi-attribute manipulation. Extensive experiments and human evaluation confirmed robust and superior manipulation performance of our methods compared to the existing baselines.

## akka-stream
다이나믹 배치를 구현하고 있고 충분히 작은 모델이라면 10000 ~ 20000  requests / sec 수준의 응답 성능을 낼 수 있습니다.
구현에 사용된 akka는 프레임워크가 아닌 고도의 동시성, 병렬성, 분산성을 가지고 있는 메세지 기반 어플레케이션 구축 툴킷으로 간주할 수 있습니다.
충분히 생산성이 있는 언어를 베이스로 하고 있기 때문에 직접 서빙 데몬에서 monolithic 한 구조로 비지니스 코드를 내재화 하는것도 가능합니다. 
예제의 코드량이 적고 추상화가 거의 없는 naive한 구현이기 때문에 동작에 관련한 거의 대부분의 요소를 블랙박스 없이 확인하고 동시에 환경 튜닝이 가능합니다.
실제 예제의 사용성은 웹과 상호 작용을 하는 어플리케이션 보다는 검색, 추천, 대화 시스템등 다수의 모델을 컨트롤하는 기반 플랫폼 시스템에 적합합니다.
